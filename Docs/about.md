# About the application
This application generates the video based on the template, context, and the input provided by the user. The video script is generated in the json format, which contains the information about the video and scenes. The input will go into the pipeline, and the pipeline will generate the video script.
Apache airflow is used to implement the pipeline. The pipeline is implemented using the following components: Apache airflow, Docker, Python. The communication between the pipeline and various actors is done using the chatbot. The chatbot is implemented using the python code.
The interim files are stored in the dropbox folder. Various users can access the dropbox folder to get the interim files, and make modifications as required. 
The final video is uploaded in to various social media platforms such as youtube, facebook, instagram, etc.
