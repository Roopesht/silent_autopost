# About the pipeline
# The business context: 
The videos are generated by a pipeline that processes the data in the following way:
1. The user choose the topic. The topics are created outside the application.
2. The user can choose what he would like to input. The input can be a idea, image, video, text.
3. User provides the input, choose template, topic and the pipeline starts.
4. The pipeline processes the input and generates video script. The video script is a json file that contains the information about the video and scenes.
5. The end will validate the video script, can make changes to the script or request changes on the video script, or even deny the video script.
6. if the video script receives any change, the pipeline will start again from step 4, but this time the pipeline will use the video script.
7. The video script is then validated for existence of the required resources such as images, videos, audio, etc.
8. The end user (content creator) can then provide the resources or request the resources from the pipeline. 
9. Once all the resources are provided the piple will generate the video, and uploads in to youtube, and sends the message to the end user.
10. The end user can then add the audio, and publish the video.
